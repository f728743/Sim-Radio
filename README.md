SimRadio app allows you to create the impression of listening to a live radio station on your iPhone.
Radio stations in Sim Radio are playlists with advanced control over the sequence of playback of audio files.
You can create a list of tracks, add DJ drops and intros, records of "news" and "advertisements", flexibly adjust the playback order of audio files related to different parts of the "air", playback the DJ’s voice over the audio track while gradually lowering the volume of the track itself. There is a possibility to program a random selection from a set of typical DJ phrases: it can be a description of the currently played composition, a transition to news or advertising, a wish for a good morning or evening depending on the current time of the day and some common phrases.

You can create your own “radio station”, put it somewhere where you can download it via http to SimRadio on your iPhone
